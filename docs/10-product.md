## Intermediary Table: `category_product`

The `category_product` table serves as a many-to-many relationship bridge between products and categories. This means that a single product can belong to multiple categories, and a single category can have multiple products associated with it. The table consists of two foreign keys: `category_id`, which references the `id` field in the `categories` table, and `product_id`, which references the `id` field in the `products` table. Both foreign keys are set to delete the associated records from this table if either the product or category is deleted, ensuring data integrity.
