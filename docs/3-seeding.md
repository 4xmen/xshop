## How to Disable or Change Seeders

The main data seeder class is located in the `database/seeder/DataSeeder` directory. You can comment out specific seeders or modify them by accessing their respective sub-classes. For example, the `VisitorSeeder` can be adjusted like this:

```php
$this->call([
    XLangSeeder::class,
    UserSeeder::class,
    GroupSeeder::class,
    PostSeeder::class,
    StateSeeder::class,
    CustomerSeeder::class,
    CategorySeeder::class,
    PropSeeder::class,
    ProductSeeder::class,
    CommentSeeder::class,
    SettingSeeder::class,
    GfxSeeder::class,
    AreaSeeder::class,
    InvoiceSeeder::class,
    VisitorSeeder::class,
    TransportSeeder::class,
    MenuSeeder::class,
    SliderSeeder::class,
    PartSeeder::class,
    EvaluationSeeder::class,
]);
```

VisitorSeeder sample:

```php
public function run(): void
{
    //
    Visitor::factory()->count(1250)->create();
}
```
